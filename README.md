# Mid Semester Analytics

## General Statistics 
1. 295 people paid their dues, but only 288 filled out the membership forms
2. Numbers are pretty consistent with last Spring
3. Last semester we had 178 pay for 'year' membership & 86 members pay for 'semester' membership
4. This semester we have 177 year & 110 semester members
5. 76% members are part of McCombs, 12% want to be eventually, 19% not McCombs related majors

## Classification
1. A lot of juniors dropped- looking back, a lot weren’t even coming to events or active in the org
2. 40 new freshmen joined
3. Word of mouth from friends? We didn’t really advertise in any different ways
4. Number of sophomores and seniors stayed relatively the same

## Fundraising
1. More members willing to pay for chill events
2. I don’t think these are a good comparison for each other but just needed to include something
3. The yellow 20-21 shirts went REALLY well, followed by teal 21-22 shirts


## External
1. It was a UFA GM + we both advertised to members (total turnout of 100+)
2. CYC didn’t advertise, so everyone that came was WBA

## Philantrophy 
1. Really good attendance record so far! Members seem to like the more crafty events such as origami, blanket making, and coloring pages!
2. Just a guess, but maybe “cranes” sounded intimidating last year

## General Meetings Attendance
1. Plan Ahead. Don't do general meetings on big days such as Valentine's Day
